## Introduction
This repository is for our ICCVW2019 paper [CGC-Net: Cell Graph Convolutional Network for Grading of Colorectal Cancer Histology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01068).

![cellgraph](./images/top.png)
A histology image (a) is typically broken into small image patches (b) for cancer grading. We propose to utilise the cell graph (d) that is built from individual nuclei after segmentation (c) to model the entire tissue micro-environment for cancer grading.
## Requirements
-   python 3.6.1
-   torch 1.1.0
-   torch-geometric 1.2.1
-   Other packages in requirements.txt

## Usage
Prerequisite: dataset images and cell/nuclei instance masks 
1. Clone the repository and set up the folders in the following structure:
```

2. Generate appearance features and distance tables.
 ```angular2html
cd CGC-Net/dataflow
python construct_feature_graph.py
```
You may need to change name and path in `class DataSetting` and `class GraphSetting(DataSetting)`.

3. To speed up training, we do sampling and fix the graph for each epoch before training start.
This step can be skipped when you want to do sampling inside dataloader by setting `dynamic_graph=True`.
```angular2html
cd CGC-Net/dataflow
python prepare_cv_dataset.py
```
You may need to change the sampling method, times and other parameters acccording to your need.

4. Train the model:
```angular2html
cd CGC-Net
sh parallel_train.sh
```
